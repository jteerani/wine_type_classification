# Classification Model with Python


## Dataset
  I retrived dataset from UCI.  
  Reference link : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine  
    
  Features :   
        1) Alcohol  
        2) Malic acid  
        3) Ash  
        4) Alcalinity of ash  
        5) Magnesium  
        6) Total phenols  
        7) Flavanoids  
        8) Nonflavanoid phenols  
        9) Proanthocyanins    
        10)Color intensity  
        11)Hue  
        12)OD280/OD315 of diluted wines  
        13)Proline  
          
  Class label is wine type which are 1 , 2 , 3.  
  Class Distribution: number of instances per class      
          	class 1 59  
	        class 2 71  
	        class 3 48  
          
          
          
# Model that I used to classify wine type :
      1) SVM
      2) Decision Tree
      3) ANN
      
      
Remark :
This source code is for studying and practicing to understand more about machine learning in particular suppervied-learning model.
